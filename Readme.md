* Start program - Start by running DecathlonStarter.java in src/main/java/com/decathlon/DecathlonStarter.java (Tested in Intellij)

* To Simulate Ranking I have created results-change.csv if you need to see ranking scenario. Please change RESULT_FILE_PATH file path to src/main/resources/results-change.csv
